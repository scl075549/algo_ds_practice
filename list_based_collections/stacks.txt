Stacks - list based, easy access to top element (adding and removing)

    LIFO - Last in, first out --> the last element you push to the stack is the
    first element that gets popped off

    Useful when you only care about the most recent elements, or the order in
    which you see and save elements actually matters.

    Push: add element to the stack
    Pop: take element off the stack

    The implementation of the stack could depend on another data structure
    under the surface, like a linked list:

        [ 1st ] --> [ next ] --> [ next ] --> [ next ] --> [ last ]
         - Popping would remove the 1st element, the next element becomes the
         new head
         - Pushing makes the new element the head, and the previous head the
         next element
