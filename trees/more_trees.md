#Tree Traversal
Do we go left first, or right first? Do we explore an entire subtree or explore by level first?

Traversal is important because we cannot search or sort our trees until we have a way to visit each element.

##Approaches to Traversal
 - Depth First Search (DFS)
   : If there are children nodes to explore, exploring them is a priority

 - Breadth First Search (BFS)
   : Priority is visiting every node on the current level before visiting child nodes
